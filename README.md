# Examples of Libp2p networks

Working on some p2p networks for other projects and wanted to make some tests with libp2p.

First install dependencies with:
```
yarn
```

Then can test two versions `stream` and `pubsub` one, just open several terminals and create nodes with:

```
yarn dev:stream <NODE_NAME>
```

or

```
yarn dev:pubsub <NODE_NAME>
```

Note, `pubsub` version is not working at the moment.
